## Built With

This project is built with an array of robust and reliable technologies to ensure high performance and seamless user experience. Below is a list of the major libraries and tools used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language, improving developer productivity and code quality.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It provides faster and leaner development for modern web projects.

- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/): The standard routing library for React, used to create a single page application with navigation without page refreshes.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs.

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): An open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications with minimal effort.

- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa): It simplifies the development of creating a data access layer by reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.

- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/): An object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database, enabling developers to more easily manipulate database data.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): An advanced, open-source relational database management system.

- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): A Java library that plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your Java by reducing the boilerplate code.
